            </h1>



            <p>
                ☛ Major Dhyan Chand was an Indian field hockey player, widely regarded as one of the greatest field
                hockey players in history.<br><br>
                ☛ He was known for his extraordinary ball control and goal-scoring feats, in addition to earning three
                Olympic gold medals, in 1928, 1932 and 1936, during an era where India dominated field hockey.<br><br>
                ☛ His influence extended beyond these victories, as India won the field hockey event in seven out of
                eight Olympics from 1928 to 1964.<br><br>
                ☛ Known as The Wizard or The Magician of hockey for his superb ball control, Chand played
                internationally from 1926 to 1949, where he scored 570 goals in 185 matches according to his
                autobiography, Goal, and over 1000 goals in his entire domestic and international career.
                <br><br> ☛ BBC called him the <strong>hockey's equivalent of Muhammad Ali".
                </strong>
                <br><br> ☛ The Government of India awarded Chand India's third highest civilian honour, the Padma
                Bhushan in 1956. His birthday, 29 August, is celebrated as National Sports Day in India every year.
                India's highest sporting honour, Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award is named after him.
                <br><br> ☛ On 29 August 1922 – his 17th birthday – Chand enlisted in the 1st Brahmans of the British
                Indian Army as a sepoy (private).[21][22] A reorganisation of the army that year resulted in the 1st
                Brahmans becoming the 1/1st Punjab Regiment. Between 1922 and 1926, Chand exclusively played army hockey
                tournaments and regimental games.
                <br><br> ☛ Chand was ultimately selected for the Indian Army team which was to tour New Zealand. The
                team won 18 matches, drew 2 and lost only 1, receiving praise from all spectators.
                <br><br> ☛Following this, in the two Test matches against the New Zealand squad, the team won the first
                and narrowly lost the second. Returning to India, Chand was promoted to Lance Naik in 1927.
                <br><br> ☛ After successfully lobbying for reintroducing field hockey in the Olympics, the newly formed
                <b>Indian Hockey Federation (IHF)</b> made preparations to send its best possible team for the 1928
                Amsterdam Olympics. In 1925, an Inter-Provincial Tournament was held to select the team members. Five
                teams participated in the inaugural nationals – United Provinces (UP), Punjab, Bengal, Rajputana and
                Central Provinces. Chand got permission from the Army to play for the United Provinces team.
                <br><br> ☛ In its first game in the tournament, Dhyan Chand as the <b>centre-forward</b> , and Marthins,
                their inside-right, performed very well together. Chand attracted much attention with his clever
                stick-work. His penetrating runs and judicious passes seemed to assure him a position in the team that
                is to take part in the Olympic Games.
                <br><br> ☛ Early in the game, it became evident that Chand was at his best. In combination with Marthins
                he took the ball away to the right and Marthins did well to give him a good pass. Quick as lightning,
                Dhyan Chand shot a goal. The ball struck one of the defenders' sticks and went into the net, giving
                goalkeeper Collie no chance. A goal within 3 minutes of the start was more than what the most optimistic
                of the UP supporters could expect. At the interval, UP led by three goals to nil.
                <br><br> ☛ In the 1928 <b> Amsterdam Summer Olympics</b>, the Indian team was put in the division A
                table, with Austria, Belgium, Denmark and Switzerland. On 17 May the Indian national hockey team made
                its Olympic debut against Austria, winning 6–0, with Chand scoring 3 goals. The next day India defeated
                Belgium 9–0; however, Chand only scored once. On 20 May, Denmark lost to India 5–0, with Chand netting
                3. Two days later, he scored 4 goals when India defeated Switzerland 6–0.
                <br><br> ☛ In 1933, Chand's home team, the Jhansi Heroes, participated in and won the Beighton Cup,
                which he considered the most prestigious of India men's national field hockey team tournaments.
                <br><br> ☛ There have been many erroneous media reports over the years claiming that Dhyan Chand scored
                6 goals in India's 8–1 victory over Germany in the 1936 Olympic final. In his autobiography Goal! Chand
                wrote:

                <i> “When Germany was four goals down, a ball hit Allen's pad and rebounded. The Germans took full
                    advantage of this and made a rush, netting the ball before we could stop it. That was the only goal
                    Germany would score in the match against our eight, and incidentally the only goal scored against
                    India in the entire Olympic tournament. India's goal-getters were Roop Singh, Tapsell and Jaffar
                    with one each, Dara two and myself three.”</i>
                <br><br> ☛ The <b> International Hockey Federation </b> records also attribute only three of the eight
                goals to Chand in the final. The final was included in the <b> Leni Riefenstahl</b> film on the 1936
                Olympics, <b>Olympia</b> . Overall, in three Olympic tournaments, Chand had scored 33 goals in 12
                matches
                <br><br> ☛ It is reported that the German leader <b>Adolf Hitler</b> was so impressed with Chand's
                skills that he offered him German citizenship and a position of Colonel in the German Army, which Dhyan
                Chand refused.
